Just enter your MySQL/LF/twitter/bit.ly user data into config.php and everything should work as it is.

You have to register a twitter app on http://dev.twitter.com/apps :

Application type: Client
Default Access type: Read & Write

You need the following keys for your config.php:

Consumer key
Consumer secret

Access Token 
Access Token Secret 


Make sure you enter a starting_id for each bot in config.php. 
If you dont the bot might not be able to cope with all the new initiatives on the first run.
(I had trouble downloading 300 of those)

Protect the 'log' submenu. There might be data included in the logs not everyone should be able to see.
